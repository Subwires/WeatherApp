# WeatherApp

Introduction: 

This  is a prototype for a mobile weather application built using ReactJS. It targets tourists looking to make choices according to the weather forecasts for their daily activities and also what to wear if they are not used to the unpredictable weather conditions. It allows them to make their own travelling routes and time preferences which it then displays on the home page.

Installation:

'npm init'

Run the app

'npm start' or 'npm run dev'(for developers) 


Note: Install the node modules dependencies using npm install. Run the app using npm start.
